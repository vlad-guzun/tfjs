      plot: "Inception is a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced the film with Emma Thomas, his wife. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets.

The ensemble cast includes Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Elliot Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.\n\nThe film was shot in six countries on four continents over six months. Its official budget was $160 million, a cost that was split between Warner Bros. and Legendary. Nolan's reputation and success with The Dark Knight (2008) helped secure the film's $100 million in advertising expenditure. Inception premiered in London on July 8, 2010, and was released in both conventional and IMAX theaters worldwide on July 16, 2010. The film grossed over $829 million worldwide and became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2010.\n\nCritics praised its screenplay, visual effects, score, and ensemble cast. Some compared Inception to Nolan's earlier film Memento (2000) for its nonlinear narrative and subject matter involving memory, and others praised its originality, complexity, and ambition. The film won four Academy Awards for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for four more: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Art Direction, and Best Original Score. It received three Grammy Award nominations for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media, and Best Score Soundtrack Album for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.",
